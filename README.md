Upon rendering the homepage's components, a fetch request is done again Stack Overflow's API to pull in all currently active bounties. From here, the user has a number of options available:
- Navigate the tabs of active bounties
    - Clicking on a bounty will open up a new tab and navigate to that particular bounty's page on Stack Overflow where the user can get additional information on the question being asked. 
- Mark a bounty for tracking
    - Click on the Mark Bounty button will mark a particular bounty for tracking. At the bottom of the page you'll be able to see all bounties currently tracked. 
- Getting details on tracked bounties
    - Users can click on the names of bounties they are currently tracking for additional details. The bounties are rendered as accordion components so clicking on the name will reveal a card component with additional details such as the bounty reward amount and the closing date for the bounty. There is also an option to navigate to the bounty page and to stop tracking the bounty. 
- log out
